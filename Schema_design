SCHEMA DESIGN
We can include a Table: Groups
group_id (INT)  //primary key
group_name (VARCHAR)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Table: Users
user_id (INT) //primary key
user_name (VARCHAR)
phone_number (VARCHAR)

Table: Messages
message_id (INT) //primary key
group_id (INT) (foreign key references groups(group_id))
user_id (INT) (foreign key references users(user_id))
message_text (TEXT)
time_sent (TIMESTAMP)

Table: Group_Members
group_id (INT) (foreign key references groups(group_id))
user_id (INT) (foreign key references users(user_id))

every group table has a group name, time it was created at and a unique group id. Similarly users table will have the user name, their phone number
then there wil be a messages table which will have unique message id, message text and the time it is sent. For group members table we will have a group id, user id.
Here I am using SQL database.
